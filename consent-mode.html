            <h1>Google Consent Mode</h1>
            <p>If you know a bit about tracking, look in your browser dev console's Network tab and filter on "collect".
                If you haven't yet chosen your cookie consent or you have chosen not to consent (and assuming no other
                privacy blocking is in place), you will still see events being sent to Google Analytics from this site.
            </p>
            <p>This is nothing nefarious and it isn't because I've misconfigured the consent management. Google
                Analytics (new and current) supports being told about user consent and will anonymise the data being
                sent when no consent is in place.</p>
            <p>This is a feature of Google Tag Manager and it's supported by Google Analytics as well as other Google
                services (all focused on ads / marketing). It's quite a new feature, and there are many sites /
                companies yet to support it and it's not straightforward to retrofit into an existing site.</p>
            <p>One prerequisite is you (the site operator) <em>must</em> integrate a Consent Management Platform (or
                develop your own). That platform does exactly what it says. It shows the UI for consent management and
                handles all the complexities therein.</p>
            <p>Consent management is a complex topic and implementing it correctly is hard. There are complex legalities
                (i.e. there are degrees of interpretation) and some site operators choose the 'nuke from orbit' approach
                by simply blocking <em>everything</em>, including even Google Tag Manager itself if there's no consent
                present.</p>
            <p>There's a lot more to be said about Google Consent Mode, but it is paving the way for a future where
                3rd-party cookies no longer exist. When that happens, site operators will be screaming out for a
                solution.</p>

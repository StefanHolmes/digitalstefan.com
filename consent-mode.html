            <h1>Google Consent Mode</h1>
            <p>I'm currently (as of end of November 2021) in the middle of removing CookieBot and replacing with
                CookiePro from OneTrust.</p>
            <p>CookieBot was 'consent mode aware' and was simple to implement. CookiePro is a more complex (and capable)
                service and I'm going through an implementation in order to learn more about it. CookiePro also recently
                added a simple option to work with Google Consent Mode.</p>
            <h2>Compliance</h2>
            <p>I'm not a legal expert and giving advice on 'cookie compliance' is so complex, people are making a living
                from doing just that. However, Google are making changes to their analytics and tagging services to
                remove the need for third-party cookies.</p>
            <p>'Google Consent Mode' is cookieless tracking with additional
                anonymisation of data. Some of the tracking for their own services will now work without cookies and in
                such a way that (according to them and their legal team) it does not require user consent. However,
                there's
                some loss in fidelity when this happens. Google mitigate this with machine learning i.e. they model
                things. 'Best guess', in other words.</p>
            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <p>This all happens via Google Tag Manager in conjunction with a consent management platform that is
                'consent mode aware' and a very specific configuration within Google Tag Manager for each tag to ensure
                all third party tags are blocked unless and until consent is granted, but where Google's own services
                can be tagged as normal and when fired, respond to the current consent status to either use cookieless
                pings (no consent present) or the standard tracking (consent granted).</p>
